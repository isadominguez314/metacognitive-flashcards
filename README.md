# metacognitive-flashcards

## Overview 
This web app can be used as a study tool that enhances metacognition while studying. It will take into account the perceived and confidence levels of each term you study and ensure that you prioritize studying terms that are less familiar and more important. I hope you enjoy! 

## Running the App
1. Clone the repository 
2. Run `npm install` in terminal 
3. In a terminal, navigate to the backend and run `node server.js` to start the backend
4. In a terminal, navigate to the frontend and run `npm start` to run the frontend

## Using the App 
To get started, enter the name of a study set in the "Study Set Name" field. If it is a new set, you can create from scratch, and if the set already exists you will be able to add more flashcards to it. When you are ready to study, click the study button with the input still set to your desired flashcard set. Follow the directions on the screen and enjoy studying!
